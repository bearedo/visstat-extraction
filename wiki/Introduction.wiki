=Introduction=
Welcome to the wiki page where you will find a number of templates that can be used to extract data from VISSTAT within [http://www.r-project.org R].

=Before you start=
  * Before you are able to extract data from VISSAT, please read [connect2Visstat] 
  * Please update your scripts regularly from this website as this will be the only place where updates to the templates will be made. You might run into unexpected results using old pieces of code!
  * Report bugs to either Niels Hintzen or report them under the [http://code.google.com/p/visstat-extraction/issues/list issues tab]
  * If you would like to contribute please read [getGoogleAccount]

=Getting started=
All templates are given in SQL code. We've chosen SQL because it can be used in a variety of different programs directly like SAS, R and SQLdeveloper. In some instances, examples in any of these languages are given to help new users to get started. Please pay close attention to the 'generic' SQL code as this is the original source.

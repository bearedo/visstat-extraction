=Getting started in R=
Start a recent version of R, preferably R 2.14.x and load the appropriate libraries
<code>library(RODBC)</code>
Copy one of the templates from the WIKI to your R editor.<br>
Example:
<code>SELECT * FROM vms WHERE 
rgn_local_date BETWEEN '01-jan-2010' and '31-jan-2010'</code>
Make sure the template is 'pasted' together and written to a new variable.
<code>query <- paste("SELECT * FROM vms WHERE 
rgn_local_date BETWEEN '01-jan-2010' and '31-jan-2010'")</code>
The query is ready to be executed, but first a connection to the VISSTAT database needs to be established. To make a connection, follow the following line where user is the username similar to your Raja username and password is either a password you got from Peter van der Kamp:
<code>conn <- odbcConnect(dsn="visstatp",uid=user,pwd=passwd,believeNRows=F)</code>
Next step is to actually evaluate the query.
<code>visstatData <- sqlQuery(conn,query)</code>
Please note that some queries might take a considerable amount of time to run! If it's not going quick enough, consider to query VISSTAT directly from Raja (more advanced).
